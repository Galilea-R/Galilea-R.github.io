My name is Galilea Resendis Gonzalez, and I am studying Data Science at ITAM. Throughout my academic journey I have acquired proficiency in several programming languages, such as Python and Java. I have also taken classes where I have learned how to use SQL, MongoDB, among others.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in playing the guitar, reading, and learning new languages.
